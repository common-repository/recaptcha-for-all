**Revolutionize reCAPTCHA:**
<li>Free for commercial use. Turnstyle is 100% free, while Google has certain usage limits.</li>
<li>Test Button to easily check your keys.</li>
<li>Only reveal page content to humans, preventing bots from stealing content and damaging your SEO.</li>
<li>Customize the box design: color, text, background, image, and more.</li>
<li>Display the box exclusively during the initial visit for a seamless user experience.</li>
<li>Identify humans and bots right from the first visit.</li>
<li>Choose specific pages for protection or opt to secure all pages.</li>
<li>If using Cloudflare Turnstile, select from three types (Managed, Non-interactive, Invisible).</li>


**Enhanced User Experience:**
The box, featuring a tailored message and button, appears only once during the user's initial site visit. Manage the message's design, text, and button – ideal for introducing cookie policies or any initial communication.

For example:
<li> By continuing to browse, you consent to our use of cookies for a better website experience.</li>
<li> Click 'OK' to verify browser compatibility.</li>
<li> Human? Simply click 'Yes'...</li>
<li> Click Yes if you have more than X years old ... </li>
<li> Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates and stay informed! Click ... </li>
<li> Connect with us on social media and stay tuned for exciting updates and content! </li>
<li> After your visit, kindly share your feedback with us.</li>
<li> Sorry, we just need to make sure you're not a robot. For best results, please make sure your browser is accepting cookies.</li>
<li> And anything else you'd like to write...</li>

If you choose Google Recaptcha, after the user click the button, the plugin will send a request to google check that visitor reputation and google sends a immediate response with an score*.
(*) Cloudflare don't have the score feature.
Then, the plugin will allow the user with required score (the score filter rate is up to you) load the page otherwise will block with a forbidden error. 

The user browser needs accept cookies and be with javascript enabled. WordPress system also request that, then, it is not a big deal.

**This can avoid the bots from stealing your content, consume your bandwidth and overload your server.**

**Widely Trusted Compatibility:**
The plugin seamlessly accommodates major search engine bots, including Google, Bing (Microsoft), Facebook, Slurp (Yahoo), and Twitter, ensuring uninterrupted access for these reputable entities.
Expand the whitelist beyond major search engines to include essential services such as site uptime monitoring, PayPal, Stripe, and more. Tailor the whitelist table to suit your specific needs.

Note: This plugin requires Google or CloudFlare site key and secret key to work. 
Look the FAQ how to get that. 
This plugin conveniently provides a "Manage keys" tab within the plugin dashboard, enabling you to effortlessly test your keys.
